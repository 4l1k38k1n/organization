# Women Who Code DC Interview Resources

This repository will attempt to collate some of the resources of questions that an interviewer might as you, as well as questions that you might want to ask the interviewer.  The different language communities might have a list of questions that pertain to their language(s) and/or framework(s), but we will do our best to provide links to those resources here as well.
