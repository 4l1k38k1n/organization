## WWCDC Front End Hack Night First Timer's Guide - The Javascript Edition

This study guide is for people who are comfortable with HTML/CSS and are looking for a really short introduction to Javascript. This particular guide is meant to help users learn and understand how to take some of the many concepts that are taught in Javascript and actually integrate them with HTML/CSS to make certain elements of a page responsive. First off a review:

### What is Front End?

The "front end" is the part of the website or web application that a person can visually see and interact with. It is on the "front" of an application. Its main purpose is to interact with the user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and structure. The front end is made up of two aspects:

* Design - aesthetics of the website or application, arrangement of elements on the screen, color, and font choices

* Front end web development (or "client-side" development) - elements that the user sees and interacts with directly. This aspect involves programming skills, primarily **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** but certainly not limited to them.

### What is Front End Development?

The focus of this study group is **Front End Development**. Though we appreciate designers joining and sharing their wisdom, the purpose of this group is to learn and encourage everyone to code.

A front end developer is the bridge that connects the designer and the back end developer. While a web designer creates the visual design and layout of the website, the web developer transforms a static design into a fully functioning website online and available to the world. By contrast, a back-end developer builds the underderlying architecture and functionality of the application (underneath the front end).

Almost all the elements that you see and interact with on any website are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interpretation of these elements is controlled by the browser. In other words, whether you use Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, the browser transforms all of the code into a website or application you can see and interact with. This includes but is not limited to fonts, colors, drop down menus, images, and forms.

### What tools do I need?

* A computer: Front end development is not restricted by operating system. You can learn front end development on Windows, Mac, and Linux (even Chrome OS!) machines.

* A text editor: you should not code using a regular word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word). While you can use Notepad or TextEdit, it's easier to code with user-friendly text editors with syntax highlighting. We recommend:
  * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Mac, Windows, Linux
  * [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) - Mac only
  * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows only

* Git and GitHub: Version control is an important part of any professional developer's toolkit. These tools back up your work, facilitate collaboration, and manage changes through versioning. First [install Git](http://git.huit.harvard.edu/guide/) on your computer, then create an account on [Github](https://github.com). For an introduction to Git and Github, refer to the [Intro to Git presentation](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/intro-to-git/#/)

* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/): An online custom environment to test your HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can save the fiddles you create and share them with others. Check out the [official documentation](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html).

* Dedication, patience and support from each other!

### Basics

Note: though many technologies and programming languages contribute to web development, we will only be discussing the languages our group focuses on.

*Content, presentation, and behavior* are the three layers of the web.

![web-layers](http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1409729756css_three-layers.png)

#### 1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML is the markup language of the web, used to structure a website's content so that the browser may read and display it. Markup consists of the structure and layout of a page's content. It is the foundation of a website and is vital to search engine optimization (SEO). A markup language specifies code for formatting content within a text file. The pieces of code used to specify the formatting are called tags.

HTML defines the `content layer` of a web page. It contains a website's information and content, including its structure and semantics. Text makes up most of the content on the web. Nevertheless, images, animations, sound, video, and whatever else an author wants to publish are also considered content.

The extension for an HTML file is **.html**

#### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
CSS defines the look and feel of the markup generated by HTML, including colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layouts, and grids. A single CSS change can affect the entire mood and tone of a Web site. The term *style sheet* refers to the CSS document itself. A web page can have one or multiple style sheets.

CSS makes up the `presentation layer` and defines how content will appear when someone accesses a page. The conventional way to view a web page is with a regular web browser, but that’s only one of many possible access methods (e.g. mobile devices, kiosks, etc.).

The extension for a CSS file is **.css**

*HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development. Every web page is written in HTML. It’s important to know these two languages really well. Together they form the bare bones of a web page, so being able to write custom HTML and CSS is an extremely important skill. It's also important to understand how these two technologies work together: HTML sets the structure of the page and CSS styles the way it looks.*

#### 3. Javascript (JS)

JavaScript is the third and final pillar of modern web development (the other two being HTML and CSS). JavaScript is the most advanced language of all three. It enables us to interact with users via sliders, drop-down menus, quizzes, and many more interactive elements. It is what makes the modern web interactive, animated, and vibrant.

JavaScript constitutes the `behavior layer` - real-time user interaction. This can range from trivial validation of a required field in an email subscription form to a sophisticated web application that acts like an ordinary desktop program.

When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do the "magic" with it. Also, JavaScript is *NOT* the same as Java. Their names may be similar (purely for marketing reasons), but they are two completely different programming languages.

The extension for a JavaScript file is **.js**

For an introduction to Javascript, refer to the [Intro to JS presentation](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/js-study-group/). Please also check out the Front End Hack Night [JavaScript Study Guide](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/organization/blob/master/learning-resources/front-end-hack-nights/javascript_study_guide.md)

*While it’s possible to embed all three layers within the same document, keeping them separate gives us one valuable advantage: we can modify or replace any of the layers without having to change the others.*

### Javascript (The Basics)

First off, the main difference between Javascript and HTML/CSS is that Javacript is considered a programming language while HTML/CSS is considered a scripting langauge. Programming languages use logic to get things to function in a certain way often times based on the behavior of the user. Where as HTML/CSS is used to section off, design and declare certain elements of a page.

For this guide, We are going to show you how to attach or add Javascript to an HTML/CSS page in order to make two things happen. First, get a button to reveal text when clicked and second create an array with a set of information and that a function pulls from and prints to the page (You'll understand what this means later).  

#### Practice - About me

Let's get started. First, lets set up your HTML/CSS file. Open up your text editor, open a new page and save it as starterpage.html preferably in a folder that will contain files for this project only. Enter the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
After this open another page and save it as "starterpage.css" and then create a third page and save it as "starterpage.js" all in the same folder.

The third file is called an external javascript file and is used in a similar fashion to an external  stylesheet. In the HTML file, add a title, the utf type, the css src and the js src to the HTML file:

```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Using Javascript</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="starterpage.css">
    <script src="starterpage.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Javascript Page</h1>
  </body>
  </html>
```
