## WWCDC Front End Hack Night First Timer's Guide

### What is Front End?

The "front end" is the part of the website or web application that a person can visually see and interact with. It is on the "front" of an application. Its main purpose is to interact with the user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and structure. The front end is made up of two aspects: 

* Design - aesthetics of the website or application, arrangement of elements on the screen, color, and font choices

* Front end web development (or "client-side" development) - elements that the user sees and interacts with directly. This aspect involves programming skills, primarily **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** but certainly not limited to them.

### What is Front End Development?

The focus of this study group is **Front End Development**. Though we appreciate designers joining and sharing their wisdom, the purpose of this group is to learn and encourage everyone to code. 

A front end developer is the bridge that connects the designer and the back end developer. While a web designer creates the visual design and layout of the website, the web developer transforms a static design into a fully functioning website online and available to the world. By contrast, a back-end developer builds the underderlying architecture and functionality of the application (underneath the front end).

Almost all the elements that you see and interact with on any website are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interpretation of these elements is controlled by the browser. In other words, whether you use Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, the browser transforms all of the code into a website or application you can see and interact with. This includes but is not limited to fonts, colors, drop down menus, images, and forms.

### What tools do I need?

* A computer: Front end development is not restricted by operating system. You can learn front end development on Windows, Mac, and Linux (even Chrome OS!) machines.

* A text editor: you should not code using a regular word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word). While you can use Notepad or TextEdit, it's easier to code with user-friendly text editors with syntax highlighting. We recommend:
  * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Mac, Windows, Linux
  * [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) - Mac only
  * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows only
  
* Git and GitHub: Version control is an important part of any professional developer's toolkit. These tools back up your work, facilitate collaboration, and manage changes through versioning. First [install Git](http://git.huit.harvard.edu/guide/) on your computer, then create an account on [Github](https://github.com). For an introduction to Git and Github, refer to the [Intro to Git presentation](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/intro-to-git/#/)

* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/): An online custom environment to test your HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can save the fiddles you create and share them with others. Check out the [official documentation](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html).

* Dedication, patience and support from each other! 

### Basics

Note: though many technologies and programming languages contribute to web development, we will only be discussing the languages our group focuses on.

*Content, presentation, and behavior* are the three layers of the web.

![web-layers](http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1409729756css_three-layers.png)

#### 1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML is the markup language of the web, used to structure a website's content so that the browser may read and display it. Markup consists of the structure and layout of a page's content. It is the foundation of a website and is vital to search engine optimization (SEO). A markup language specifies code for formatting content within a text file. The pieces of code used to specify the formatting are called tags. 

HTML defines the `content layer` of a web page. It contains a website's information and content, including its structure and semantics. Text makes up most of the content on the web. Nevertheless, images, animations, sound, video, and whatever else an author wants to publish are also considered content.

The extension for an HTML file is **.html**

#### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
CSS defines the look and feel of the markup generated by HTML, including colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layouts, and grids. A single CSS change can affect the entire mood and tone of a Web site. The term *style sheet* refers to the CSS document itself. A web page can have one or multiple style sheets. 

CSS makes up the `presentation layer` and defines how content will appear when someone accesses a page. The conventional way to view a web page is with a regular web browser, but that’s only one of many possible access methods (e.g. mobile devices, kiosks, etc.).

The extension for a CSS file is **.css**

*HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development. Every web page is written in HTML. It’s important to know these two languages really well. Together they form the bare bones of a web page, so being able to write custom HTML and CSS is an extremely important skill. It's also important to understand how these two technologies work together: HTML sets the structure of the page and CSS styles the way it looks.*

#### 3. Javascript (JS)

JavaScript is the third and final pillar of modern web development (the other two being HTML and CSS). JavaScript is the most advanced language of all three. It enables us to interact with users via sliders, drop-down menus, quizzes, and many more interactive elements. It is what makes the modern web interactive, animated, and vibrant.

JavaScript constitutes the `behavior layer` - real-time user interaction. This can range from trivial validation of a required field in an email subscription form to a sophisticated web application that acts like an ordinary desktop program. 

When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do the "magic" with it. Also, JavaScript is *NOT* the same as Java. Their names may be similar (purely for marketing reasons), but they are two completely different programming languages. 

The extension for a JavaScript file is **.js**
  
For an introduction to Javascript, refer to the [Intro to JS presentation](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/js-study-group/). Please also check out the Front End Hack Night [JavaScript Study Guide](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/organization/blob/master/learning-resources/front-end-hack-nights/javascript_study_guide.md)

*While it’s possible to embed all three layers within the same document, keeping them separate gives us one valuable advantage: we can modify or replace any of the layers without having to change the others.*

### How do I get started?

Awesome, congrats on taking the first step to learning how to code! Now how do we get started? Believe it or not, it's by **Building Your First Web Page!!**

HTML and CSS are independent of one another and should remain that way in separate HTML and CSS files. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always be the `content layer` and CSS will always be the `presentation layer`. Now that you understand the importance of each, let's get started!

##### Common HTML Terms

###### Elements

HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. `Elements` are the bits that make up web pages, they define the structure and content of different pieces within a page. These pieces could be text, images, media, or links. Some commonly used HTML elements are:

* `<p>` - Paragraph
* `<img>` - Image
* `<h1>` through `<h6>` - Multiple levels of page headings
* `<a>` - Anchor/hyperlink/URL

As you may have noticed, all elements are identified by the use of less than and greater than angle brackets `< >` surrounding the element name. Together these angle brackets and the element name form a `Tag`.

###### Tags

An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater than sign - for example, `<a>`. A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less than sign followed by a forward slash and the element’s name, and then ends with a greater than sign - for example, `</a>`. What falls between these two tags will be the content of the anchor link.

Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags, but there are some exceptions where tags do not require a closing tag. 

###### Attributes

`Attributes` are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the `id` attribute, which uniquely identifies an element and the `class` attribute, which classifies an element. 

Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an element’s name. Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an `=` sign and then a quoted attribute value. For example, see the `<a>` tag with a `href attribute` below:

![HTML-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupurkapoor/WWCDC-FEHN-FTGuide/master/assets/images/HTML-1.png)

##### Practice - Hello HTML!

Let's create your first HTML page. 

1. Open your text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, Sublime Text, etc.). Create a new file named hello.html and save it to a location you won't forget.

2. In the hello.html file, add the document structure, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` document type, and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

	```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	  <head>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	  </body>
	</html>
	```

3. Inside the `<head>` element, let’s add a `<meta>` and `<title>` element. `<meta>` elements define data (information) about data, otherwise known as metadata. Metadata is not be displayed on the page, but is used by the browser. Our `<meta>` element below defines the [character encoding](http://techterms.com/definition/characterencoding) (how computers understand text) of our document. The `<title>` tag sets the title of the page in the window or tab of browser.  

	```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	  <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <title>My first HTML page</title>
      </head>
	  <body>
	  </body>
	</html>
	```
	
4. Inside the `<body>` element, let’s add `<h1>` and `<p>` elements. The `<h1>` element should include our heading and the `<p>` element should include a simple paragraph.

	```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	  <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <title>My first html page</title>
      </head>
	  <body>
	   <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
	   <p>This isn't just any page, this is my beginning.</p>
	  </body>
	</html>
	```

5. Now it's time to open this page in a browser! Locate your hello.html file and double click on it to open it. You can also use the file open or open with option in your browser menu. This is how my HTML document looks in my text editor:
	
![HTML-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupurkapoor/WWCDC-FEHN-FTGuide/master/assets/images/HTML-2.png)

And this is how it looks when I access the page in Chrome:

![HTML-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupurkapoor/WWCDC-FEHN-FTGuide/master/assets/images/HTML-3.png)

Voila! You just created your first HTML page. Congratulations! Now let's take a look at CSS. 

##### Common CSS Terms

###### Selectors

`Selectors` select elements on an HTML page so that they can be styled. Selectors can select a single or multiple elements. 

Before we start looking into different types of selectors, let's look at CSS syntax. Though it's different from HTML, it's really simple to pick up! The general format looks like this: 

```
selector {
    property: value;
}

```
So for example, if we wish to change the `color` property of a paragraph tag to blue:

```
p {
	color: blue;
}
```

Now the above code would change the color of ***ALL*** paragraph tags to blue on the page. For granularity we can use other attributes as well to target specific elements.

```
p#container {
	color: blue;
}

p.error {
	color: red;
}

```

In the above code, the `<p>` tag with an `id` attribute of container would be colored blue. IDs are unique within a page - only one element should contain that particular ID (uniquely identified) Meanwhile, every element with a `class` attribute of error will be red. Classes are used for multiple elements on a page with the same style. In CSS, the `id` attribute is selected using a `#` hash/pound symbol, while the `class` attribute is selected using the dot or period symbol `.`.

**Common Selectors:**

1. `*` - Universal selector. The star symbol will target every single element on the page. It literally means 'ALL'. Be very careful while using this selector as it would apply the style on every single element of your web page.
2. `#id` - Id selector. To select a single element by its `id` attribute. 
3. `.class` - Class selector. To select elements by their `class` attribute. 
4. `h1`, `p`, `body`, `div`  - Type selectors. To select an element by its tag type.
5. `div.article table` - Descendant selector. When you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular elemen. In this case the CSS rule would only be applied to a `table` that is inside a `div` with a `class` attribute of 'article' 

##### Referencing CSS from Within an HTML Page

For our CSS and HTML files to talk to each other we need to reference our CSS file within our HTML document. The best practice is to include all of our styles in a single external style sheet, which is referenced from within the `<head>` element of our HTML document:

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
```

##### Practice - Styling Hello HTML!

1. Create a new file called `main.css`. Save this file in the same folder as your `hello.html` file.

2. Using our text editor, lets add some color and change the font of the `<h1>` tag, and change the font face of the `<p>` tag:

```
h1 {
	font-family: Arial;
	color: blue;
}

p {
	font-family: Arial;
}

```

Now, the Gurus of programming have wisely adviced us to always be DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself. But we are repeating ourselves above! Both of our elements have the exact same font! Now there are two ways to resolve this: 

* If the file is as simple as ours, with nothing else but just an `<h1>` and a `<p>` tag, we can apply the `font-family` to the `<body>` tag of the page, which will affect most elements within the `<body>` tag. This is called inheritance.

```
body {
	font-family: Arial;
}

h1 {
	color: blue;
}
```

* If our page has lots of elements and we only wanted to target the `<h1>` and the `<p>` tag, we can apply styles to both tags using a `,` as a separator!

```
h1, p {
	font-family: Arial;
}

h1 {
	color: blue;
}

```

![MAIN-css-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupurkapoor/WWCDC-FEHN-FTGuide/master/assets/images/MAIN-css-1.png)

Now we need to reference this CSS file from within our HTML file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8">
     <title>My first html page</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    </head>
  <body>
   <h1> Hello World!! </h1>
   <p>This isn't just any page, this is my beginning.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's open the HTML file in the browser to see the styling in action.

Yayyyyy!!!

### Okay, what's next?

The only logical next step is to NOT STOP! Check out our learning resources section and continue your journey. All the best and congratulations!

Remember, even though we did access your page via a web browser, it's not actually on the Internet! For that you would need to 
[host](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) your page online. That's an advanced topic that shouldn't worry about right now!
