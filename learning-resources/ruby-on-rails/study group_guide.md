##What is this study group for?

The Women Who Code Ruby on Rails study group is a space where women can come together and help each other learn ROR. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more ROR experience to help out those that are just starting. Every study group will have the following format:

6:30pm (or 6pm depending on the host) - Begin
6:40 - 6:50pm - Quick Introductions 
6:50 - 8:00pm - CODE!
8:00 - 8:15pm - Lighting Talk (if planned)
8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up 

We want the majority of the study group to be left for people to code and learn. If you are a first timer to coding or ROR we have suggested courses that you can follow. For those who are more familiar with the language we encourage you to bring in projects that you are working on. We ask that you pleaaaaasee do not bring in or ask questions about work
