# Women Who Code DC Ruby on Rails Resources

##Suggested Learning Tools

You will get the most out of our meetups if you follow one of our suggested resources. These are the classes/books/resources that our members know the best and can offer the most support for.

We will not assist with work problems. We are here to help you learn the skills that will help you solve work problems, but asking about work related problems derails the productivity of everyone at the event. Repeated requests for solutions to work problems will result in our leaders asking you to leave.

###CS Beginner

If you want a great introdution to Computer Science and what programming is watch:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info - Harvard's CS50 Intro to CS class
(the first 3 weeks are essential but if you get into it...keep watching :) )

###Ruby Beginner

* [Try Ruby](tryruby.org)
  * Short Interactive, Intro to the Ruby Programming Language
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby)
  * Take the Ruby Language Path to get a deeper introduction to the language
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
  * An introduction to Ruby that runs from the basic all the way up through object-oriented programming.
* [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) 
  * Testing based approach to learning Ruby (I really like this guide because it teaches you test based development).  Works best if you do not look to closely at the error messages because they give away the answer.
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)
  * Go through the exercises
