# WWCDC Python Study Group first timer's guide

If you are brand new to Python, we recommend coming to the first meeting of the month which is First-Timers Night. You are welcome to come any week, but that first week will be the one when we cater to beginners.

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed, general-purpose programming language. It has an easy-to-learn, pseudocode-like syntax, which makes it a very nice first language for beginning programmers. Python comes with a rich standard library with all sorts of useful tools, and there is a vibrant open-source community that provides tooling and support for broad array of applications, from scientific or statistical analysis to data science to web development.

## What is Python used for?
In its bare form (no external libraries), Python is a powerful scripting language. It can be used to write all kinds of programs that can be invoked through the command-line, from a simple tip-calculator to a fully-featured command-line Twitter client, or a program that automatically corrects your code for style consistency. (It can also be used to write desktop applications, but that would require a graphics library.) Because of the expressive and concise syntax, Python is a great tool to reach for if you have a problem that needs a quick programmatic solution.

Additionally, the Python community provides a variety of tools for common applications. For web development, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a fully-featured web framework, similar to Ruby on Rails. It powers a lot of popular websites, including Pinterest and Instagram. There are also lightweight web framework options, like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

Python is a big player in the science and data communities. The [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) family of libraries support a variety of science, math, and engineering applications, and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a popular Python library for machine learning. The [natural language toolkit (nltk)](http://www.nltk.org/) is one of the best tools anywhere for parsing and analyzing natural human language.

Python is also the main user-programming language for the [raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

## Which tools do I need?
You can write and run Python programs on PCs, Macs, and Linux machines, so long as you have a Python interpreter installed. (On Mac and most Linux distributions, Python comes installed out-of-the-box.) See below for installation instructions on Windows.
* [EDIT] Do Windows users need to install PowerShell, or does that come with?

You will also need a program to edit your code. While there are Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) for Python, we recommend starting with a regular text editor. [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a popular and powerful text editor that is available on all OSs. [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is also a nice option for Windows. We strongly recommend that you do not use a bare-bones text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac for editing your code. These programs lack syntax-highlighting and have no support for plugins that can help you learn faster and be more productive.

## Installing Python
Open up a Terminal window (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac, ? on Linux) and type `python` into the prompt. If a different prompt shows up, congratulations! You already have Python installed. If you got an error, follow these instructions to install Python:

### A note on Python versions
Python 3 introduced a lot of breaking changes, so even though it's been around for a decade, many people still use Python 2. There are still some [popular libraries](http://py3readiness.org/) that don't support Python 3, but the vast majority do. So, for most purposes, it doesn't matter which version you use, but Python 2.7 is probably the safest.
