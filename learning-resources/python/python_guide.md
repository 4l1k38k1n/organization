# Python Study Group 

## What is this study group for?

This study group is still a work in progress but the general idea is to have a space where women can come together and help each other learn and understand Python. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There would always be at least one mentor/leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem! 
Every study group will have the following format:

* 6:30pm  - Begin
* 6:40 - 6:50pm - Quick Introductions 
* 6:50 - 8:00pm - CODE!
* 8:00 - 8:15pm - Lightning Talk (a quick presentation or talk) (if planned)
* 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up 

All study groups will be scheduled via our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/) page. 
We are not yet sure when and where we would meet, but we'll update that soon.
