# Women Who Code DC Slack Guide  

---

## What is Slack?

Slack is a messaging application used by workplaces and organizations to facilitate communication and collaboration. An organization creates a team in Slack, which contains open channels (e.g., #javascript) or private groups (e.g., fehn-leads). You can also send private direct messages to other people and even small groups. 

Even though Slack has private groups and direct messages, you should try to use channels whenever possible instead to encourage information sharing and transparency. You never know who on the team may know the answer and can help you out!

## Women Who Code DC + Slack

Women Who Code DC uses Slack to communicate in between Women Who Code DC events and study group sessions. Use Slack to ask other WWCDC members technical questions, get advice on career issues, share learning resources, and broadcast events. 

Most of the messages and content you post in our Slack channels should relate to our mission of teaching and encouraging women to code. Popular topics include women in technology, learning how to code, technology career advice, and the DC Tech scene. If you are unsure about whether or not you should post something in Slack, feel free to reach out to any of the Women Who Code DC leads!

Spam, harassment, and messages and content that violate our code of conduct are not tolerated in the WWCDC Slack. Individuals who violate our code of conduct will have their Slack accounts disabled. 

## Channels Guide

Broad channels all start with an underscore (`_`).

- #_general
- #_jobs
- #_announcements
- #front-end-hack-night

*Have an idea for a new channel?* Reach out to a member of the Women Who Code DC leadership team and propose it in #general. If there's interest in the new channel and it's not already served by an existing channel, then go ahead and create it in Slack!

## Private Groups

If you are a member of the WWCDC leadership team and need access to any of the groups below, ask another one of the leads for access.

## Slack Usage Guidelines

- Mention other members by using @ and their username. Mentioning is good as the member may not have seen your message or follow up reply otherwise!
- Avoid using @channel and instead use @here, especially in large channels such as general and announcements
- Be careful with use of emojis that could cause headaches or seizures for some of our members

## Managing Notifications
- don't feel like you need to read every single message
- notifications only for direct messages, mentions, or all messages for certain channels
- can subscribe to have certain words highlighted
- can have different settings for a laptop vs your phone
