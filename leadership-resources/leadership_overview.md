## Leadership Expectations

The most important requirement for our leadership team is that they are active members of the DC Women Who Code Network. It's important for our members to see leads attending meetups and interacting with other members; this opens our most important channel for gaining feedback. 
Being active on Slack is our second priority. Welcoming newcomers, encouraging conversations and providing a nurturing technical community are all enabled through Slack.

We expect leads on every team to attend at least 2 public Women Who Code DC Meetups a month (going to tons of leadership meetings doesn't count!) The purpose is for you to be visible and engaged in the community, you don't have to *lead* the meetup, or even understand/work on the topic at hand. A lot of us find these Meetups a good time to put an hour into WWC-related work. 

Our leadership team is filled with productive and powerful people. It's to be expected that some of us will get bogged down with our paid work, other things in life, etc. so please let your teammates know when you need to step back from your responsibilities for a while so we can plan and adjust. 

We start our relationship with leads by holding an introductory of Evaluation Period. **The Evaluation Period is designed for the new lead to evaluate the position and team and decide of they want to pursue a leadership role.** During this time, whoever recruited the new lead will guide her through the expectations of being a lead. **New leads and their Mentor will be responsible each week for coordinating on Slack to find 2 volunteers for the coming meetups, and to ensure the Meetup.com event is created and ready to happen.**


Directors: We have a separate page for [Directors Roles & Responsibilities], but the expectations above apply for Directors, Managers, and Leads alike.
