## Becoming part of the Women Who Code DC Leadership Team
#### Hi! You're probably at this page because either:
- a Women Who Code DC Lead sent you here
or 
- you're reading the WWC DC Documentation just for fun
In either case, you're probably a good fit for the job!

Next steps in getting involed are:
##### Definitely:
- Read through our [Leadership Roles and Responsibilities]() to get an idea of what you're thinking of signing up for.

##### Probably:
- Contact our Director of [Education]() or [Networking]() and say hi
- Tweet at us @WomenWhoCodeDC
- Ask in on Slack (womenwhocodedc.slack.com) for access to the Leadership Channels that you're interested in.
