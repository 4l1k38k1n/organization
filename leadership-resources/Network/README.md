## Network Team Expectations

The goal of the network team is to help expand WWC DC’s outreach and events throughout the city. The team is integral to the success of our chapter. They are often the first contact for people that are learning about WWC and are the forward facing presence of our network!

Members of the Network Team need to be active members of Women Who Code.
While most of our roles can be completed at home, if a Network Manager does not attend meetups, she will be unable to answer basic questions about the group and be confused about what we are doing.
We expect our Network Team members to attend at least 2 WWC DC events a month.

We also expect team members to join periodic 1 hour work-calls, where we work on our own WWC projects with one another. 

### Roles 
#### Network Director
###### Currently filled by Kaylyn Gibilterra

This director is responsible for keeping up communications between all of leadership and the network. This includes organizing the agendas for leadership meetings, sending emails to the DC network, and regularly communicating with HQ.

Internal to the network, she should be highly visible and approachable to the members. Attend the regular sessions as well as irregular training opportunities to watch how they are going, as well as to meet the members. It should not take a member being active in the network for very long before they meet this (or any) director. She should always be considering how to get input from more members through focus groups, surveys, or any other creative outlets.

Developing a monthly newsletter that has clear information and action items is a goal for this director in 2015. Thinking about accessibility and diversity when communicating will also be important. 

Outside of the network, she will be one of the most visible members of the network. The more external events she can attend, the better (although huge preference for internal over external events). Key organizations to network with include all of the DCFemTech organizations, popular technical meetups and events, political officials around the city, etc. 

She will play a key role in organizing large multi-organizational events that happen throughout the year. Whether that is a DCFemTech event, a conference in the city, or some other tech event, she will work to help connect WWC with those groups. She will also work with the HQ teams to continue developing ways for more networks to increase activity. This could include helping with communication outside of SF.

This director will lead the Network Team as well as work with HQ on network and sponsor strategy.

#### Network Groups

##### Partnerships Group
###### Lead: [Su Kim](), Additional Managers: [Tegan Twedt]()
This manager is the first point of contact for many companies throughout DC. As such, this person needs to be organized, comfortable with networking, and skilled in communication so that she can properly work with company employees and our entire leadership team.

The most important aspect of this is creating a way for everyone to be on the same page about how hosts are contacted, who should contact them, and how we can find hosts for the future. The Partnerships folder in our google drive has a lot of awesome resources for contacting hosts and is where all strategies should be added. Currently we could use more development in our sourcing of hosts and making sure that they feel valued for helping us.

We use Insightly to manage all of our emails - with some notes on our use of it here. When an email is sent to WWCodeDC@gmail.com the Partnerships Manager is responsible for redirecting it to the appropriate project / location in Insightly.

For One Time Events
Each Event Manager (Professional Development, Technical, Entrepreneurship, and Special Events) is responsible for planning and coordination of their respective events. When they do have the details for an event planned out, they need to send a short description of the event to the Partnerships Manager that will then be sent out to our hosts listserv. When a host is decided upon, the Partnerships Manager will then introduce them to the respective manager and any related leads so that they can continue planning for the event.

In summary, this manager is responsible for sourcing (which can include setting up an initial meeting to explain what WWC is - some hosts really want that) as well as communicating what hosts are available for events to the rest of the leadership team. She is not in charge of following up throughout the event. That responsibility belongs to the appropriate leads running the event(s). Everyone should always CC WWCodeDC@gmail.com in their WWC interactions to increase transparency and avoid confusion among our hosts.

This manager will work with the Network and Learning Directors, Professional Development Manager, Study Group Leads, and active members that prepare our events.



#### Entrepreneurship Group 
(Network Entrepreneur or Intraprenurial Operator or Operations Intrapreneur)
###### Lead: Veni Kunche, Additional Managers: Liz Akinsanmi
This manager is our liaison with a lot of other awesome people, organizations and groups throughout DC. Whether it is involvement with new startups, ventures, or events, this manager will often be the first to hear and report about them. As relationships are established throughout the city, and groups want to be involved with WWC DC, this manager would work with the Partnerships Manager to make sure they hear about what opportunities we have for them.

Additionally, she will be responsible for encouraging our techie women to be the incredible founders, startup team members, intrapreneurs they can be. It is said that women are statistically more risk averse which leads to lower involvement with startups. Other studies say women want a community, which we provide, and hopefully we can turn that into a launching point for them to start their entrepreneurial goals. 

This manager will work with the Network Director, Special Events, Partnerships Manager, to identify which opportunities have the highest potential for the network.
Professional Development Group
Currently filled by Anne Glazer
This manager is responsible for putting together our events related to Professional Development - recruiting, resume workshops, job tips, salary and benefits negotiating, networking sessions, life coaching - whatever seems most applicable at the time! These events will probably involve more outreach in the community to find reputable help for panelists or other events (compared to sourcing from our existing members - but maybe we will have some experts!). 

One consideration for this manager will be to figure out how we can source what events our members most want. This might not be needed though (who doesn’t want life coaching, etc?!)

#### Professional Development Group 
(merge with Professional Development Group?)
###### Lead: Natassja Linzau, Additional Managers: Pamela Vong, Zuri Hunter

This role has not been fully developed, but one of the hottest area in terms of “external” attention is if we are doing any mentoring. Things like Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code, local hackathons, summer camps (Mayor Muriel is thinking of having one) - all of that is driving a lot of media attention.

The other space that we want to focus on is internal mentoring [for late 2015 or 2016! We could split this into two roles as well]. While the media attention is not there yet, it’s coming - specifically for “retention of women currently in the field.” So that is the other area of mentoring that we can strategize and tackle! There was development for a WWC Mentoring App here, but it hasn’t been worked on recently.

NL: I see our plan for mentoring in about three phases so I will write it out here and then people can edit or adapt as necessary.  As far as roles go, there are a few different roles that fit into mentoring:

Mentoring Education--someone who provides resources and tools to the WWC-DC community for understanding mentoring.  This person could also potentially be the lead on organizing mentoring info evenings.

College Liaison--someone who can develop relationships with contacts at the local universities to get women who are involved in computer science-related fields at the college level involved in WWC-DC.

Mentoring Policy and Strategy--someone to develop an overall strategy for our mentoring activities and some guidelines to go along with the strategies.  [NOTE: Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t we already tentatively decide that we want to focus at least at first on women who are already working as computer programmers, etc., and who need support to stay in the field and continue to develop professionally (as opposed to “newbies” who are just beginning to take an interest in the field)?]

Mentoring Opportunity Development--someone who can identify opportunities for mentoring, both internal and external to WWC-DC and work to solidify and/or communicate these opportunities to those who are interested and eligible.  Part of this may be to establish working relationships with other women in tech groups who are interested in offering mentoring opportunities so we can pool our resources.

Phase I--Information Gathering.  We will research mentoring models and processes, share articles about what works and what doesn’t, find examples of successful mentoring programs and analyze what elements made those programs successful, identifying any specific approaches that work well for women in programming.

Phase II--Strengthen Existing Internal Mentoring Opportunities.  We will look at how to strengthen the current opportunities that exist in WWC-DC for mentoring, and specifically identify and “advertise” (with the help of the Web & Social Media Manager) the opportunities for study groups, hack-a-thons, etc. where mentoring can occur organically.  

Phase III--Kickoff/Launch of Mentoring Awareness Program.  Plan at least one event (or maybe ongoing) to provide education about opportunities for mentoring that exist in the workplace (external to WWC-DC) and within our organization.  We may also want to “partner” with other women-in-tech organizations in the area during this stage, depending on what the landscape is like at this point.  This is also a great opportunity for professional development and mentoring to merge a bit, because they are so interrelated.  

#### Brand Group
###### Lead: Laura Phelps, Additional Managers: Lauren Jacobson
This group is responsible for helping us navigate how to properly and successfully build a brand - specifically in DC, but hopefully for all of HQ. Going through the Brand Identity Needs and seeing where we can help and get started as a network will really help us establish our brand in the city (and hopefully help more women realize that they can learn to code and can find peers in the industry!) A lot of this role will be determined by how responsive and receptive HQ is to the changes, but hopefully we can come up with a productive way to bring them on board.

Additionally thinking about PR for the DC Network will be fantastic [might be an additional person?]. So far, none of us know anything about PR, so we have a low bar to raise. But thinking about how we present ourselves to the media would be fantastic!

This group is also responsible for any content that we have on our social media sites (twitter, medium right now) as well as gathering content for our blog. The major goal right now is to showcase the awesome stories about our members - whether that is great new jobs they are getting, the learning resources they are completing, or really anything else that makes them look awesome to the outside world. They have a form for getting blogs on the national WWC site here! And then sourcing Applaud Hers (which includes encouraging study group leads to add in accomplishments they hear about) as well as any other promotional material we can share with HQ and the rest of the world, would be awesome.
