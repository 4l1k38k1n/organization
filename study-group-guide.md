### Study Groups & Hack Nights

Here is some information around what we look for in recurring study groups or hack nights. The main pieces that we look for before starting a group are:

* Interest in the topic/space
* 2 Leads that can dedicate time to going every week (or at least relatively often)
* Hosts for the events

Getting all of these things in place takes some time. So as long as you are interested in the study group and will be for a fair bit of time - reach out to us at <WWCodeDC@gmail.com> about where we stand regarding the group!  

Anyway, if you aren't sure what the difference is between a study group and a hack night - the main piece is that a study group is for following a certain book/online course/something with weekly "assignments" so to speak. A hack night is more free form where people could work on open source projects or personal development that they want to get done!  

*Currently we are experimenting with splitting our weekly sessions into two groups - one that is focused on "hack nights" and the other that follows a "learning plan." We will update as we learn!*

#### Hack / Work Nights

* Language specific or agnostic
* Free for all to work on whatever projects / tools they desire
* Leader encourages 5-15 minute demos of projects and technologies at the start
* Promote members working together to build an app/website/hack for X
* Less structured, “mentors” may float around if in attendance

#### Study Groups

* Should have some sort of plan for the duration of the study group 
	* coursera class
	* book to follow
	* free online lectures (with problem sets)
	* Leader could create a lesson plan, but that would require more commitment and understanding of what they want to go over
* Have an leader that is dedicated to going through all of the materials
* Set a timeline for the group (9 weeks of python, 12 weeks of interview prep, etc)
	* Members can join late or come in and out
	* Awesome opportunity for someone to document their work throughout the course so that if people come late they can use that as a resource!
	* At the start of a new group, it could be beneficial to schedule out everything that you will learn so people can follow along. And then after one round you will have a group of people that all know the materials and can help those that join later.
* Promote communication, collaboration, and camaraderie between group members
* Promote that study group members attend larger DC tech events relevant to their work
	* JS Study group goes to DC JS meetups, Java to DC Java, etc    
* **Examples**
	* Follow the coursera course [Intro to Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
	* Go through the book [Cracking the Coding Interview (Java)](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
	* Do something awesome like what the NYC chapter did with the [Internet of Things](http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/199804712/)
