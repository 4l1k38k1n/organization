## New Events

New study groups are the best! If you have an idea for something recurring or any other type of event - hopefully this can be useful for you.

### Irregular Events

Most events at this point will be planned/organized by the leadership team. But if you have an idea for a panel you would like to see, or tech talk that would be interesting - absolutely reach out to <WWCodeDC@gmail.com>! Depending on the calendar of other events, we can see when might be a good time for us to host it!

### Study Groups & Hack Nights

Study Groups and Hack Nights take a bit more planning and organization. The main things that we need to start these events are:

* Interest in the topic/space
* 2 Leads that can dedicate time to going every week
* Hosts for the events

Getting all of these things in place does take some time. So if you have interest in the event, we won't be able to start something new up overnight. It takes time to plan, make sure hosts are on board, and give enough lead time for poeple to sign up. And if we have a full backlog of new events coming up, it might take a bit longer. But as long as you're interested in the study group and will be for a fair bit of time - we could be the perfect group for you!  

Of course, on that note - if you run a study group for a few months, it is absolutely ok to stop leading it. But once the group gets started, it is a lot easier than you might think to find more people that can help lead the group, rather than spending all of the time doing it yourself! (Also part of the reason we look for 2 leads, rather than 1)

Anyway, if you aren't sure what the difference is between a study group and a hack night - the main piece is that a study group is for following a certain book/online course/something with weekly "assignments" so to speak. A hack night is more free form where people could work on open source projects or personal development that they want to get done!  

Some Best Practices for both:

#### Hack / Work Nights

* Language specific or agnostic
* Free for all to work on whatever projects / tools they desire
* Leader encourages 5-15 minute demos of projects and technologies at the start
* Promote members working together to build an app/website/hack for X
* Less structured, “mentors” may float around if in attendance

#### Study Groups

* Should have some sort of plan for the duration of the study group 
	* coursera class
	* book to follow
	* free online lectures (with problem sets)
	* Leader could create a lesson plan, but that would require more commitment and understanding of what they want to go over
* Have an leader that is dedicated to going through all of the materials
* Set a timeline for the group (9 weeks of python, 12 weeks of interview prep, etc)
	* Members can join late or come in and out
	* But have a focus so that the event can be “we are going over chapter 3” and questions can revolve around that.
	* Awesome opportunity for someone to document their work throughout the course so that if people come late they can use that as a resource!
* Promote communication, collaboration, and camaraderie between group members
* Promote that study group members attend larger DC tech events relevant to their work
	* JS Study group goes to DC JS meetups, Java to DC Java, etc    
* **Examples**
	* Follow the coursera course [Intro to Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython)
	* Go through the book [Cracking the Coding Interview (Java)](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
	* Do something awesome like what the NYC chapter did with the [Internet of Things](http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/199804712/)

Again, reach out to <WWCodeDC@gmail.com> if you are interested in starting a new group!
